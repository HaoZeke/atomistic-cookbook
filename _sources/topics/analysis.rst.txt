Analysis and post-processing
============================

This section contains recipes that analyze the output of a simulation,
for post-processing, diagnostics or visualization purposes.

                :alt: This example uses featomic and metatensor to compute structural properties for the structures in a training dataset for a ML potential. These are then used with simple dimensionality reduction algorithms (implemented in sklearn and skmatter) to obtain a simplified description of the dataset, that is then visualized using chemiscope.

            .. image:: ../examples/lpr/images/thumb/sphx_glr_lpr_thumb.png
                :alt: In this tutorial, we calculate the SOAP descriptors of an amorphous silicon dataset using featomic, then compute the local prediction rigidity (LPR) for the atoms of a "test" set before and after modifications to the "training" dataset has been made.

            .. image:: ../examples/roy-gch/images/thumb/sphx_glr_roy-gch_thumb.png
                :alt: This notebook analyzes the structures of 264 polymorphs of ROY, from Beran et Al, Chemical Science (2022), comparing the conventional density-energy convex hull with a Generalized Convex Hull (GCH) analysis (see Anelli et al., Phys. Rev. Materials (2018)). It uses features computed with featomic and uses the directional convex hull function from scikit-matter to make the figure.

                :alt: This example shows how to rotate equivariant properties of atomic structures using the scipy and quaternionic libraries. The equivariant properties for this example are computed by the featomic library.
